Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools in the creation and maintenance of high-quality software systems which involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of these software products.
It enables the creation of reliable, scalable, and innovative software solutions that meet user needs.

2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The development of programming languages 
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
And the advent of structured programming in the 1970s

3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

•	Requirements: to gather and document user needs and system requirements for a better development.
•	Design: Create high-level and detailed designs of the software design and user interface.
•	Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
•	Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
•	Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
•	Maintenance: Providing on-going support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment

4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall: A model that divides a project into a series of sequential phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation)
Agile: Scope of work is flexible and project planning adaptive (It makes work fast and easy)

5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Their roles are crucial in software engineering. Each role contributes to different aspects of the software development process, such as coding, testing, 
project management, and user experience design, to ensure the successful delivery of software products.
Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
While project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are software suites that provide comprehensive tools that enable the writing, debugging, and testing of codes (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse). 
Version Control Systems (VCS) is software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Software engineers are faced with different challenges in the process of software development. 
Requirements Change: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

8. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

1. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process of crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
Prompt engineering make your instructions and questions clear and specific so that AI understands exactly what you want.
It helps clear confusion which leads to better AI response.

2. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Example:  Vague prompt: Where is china?
         Improved prompt: In what continent is china?
